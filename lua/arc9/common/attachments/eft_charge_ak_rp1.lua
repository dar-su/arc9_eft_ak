ATT.Description = [[The RP-1 charging handle by Zenit is a milled detail, manufactured with D16T aluminum alloy with black coating. 
It's compatible with all models of AK family rifles. 
The RP-1 is larger and more convenient than the standard charging handle, which improves the weapon ergonomics and makes handling more comfortable. 
The RP-1 is installed above the base handle through kit-enclosed bolts.
